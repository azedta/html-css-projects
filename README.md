# 🌐 HTML & CSS Foundations  
### UI Components, Layout Systems & Product Pages

A curated collection of **HTML & CSS projects** focused on **layout systems, reusable UI components, and real-world page composition**.

This repository demonstrates my front-end fundamentals: **semantic markup, modern CSS (Flexbox & Grid), component-based thinking, and layout clarity** — the skills required before scaling into JavaScript frameworks and full-stack applications.

> 🎯 **Goal:** build production-ready UI foundations using vanilla HTML & CSS only.
